Road accident analysis involves repositories related to analyzing various aspects of road accidents, including their causes, patterns, and consequences and thereby predicted the future causes and to provide insights that can help improve road safety, reduce accidents, and minimize their impact on society.

### Dataset
The project is driven by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India, and leverages insights from a comprehensive dataset obtained from https://morth.nic.in/.

### Analysis Model
The analytical backbone is a Time Series Forecasting model known as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Trained on data up to 2019, the model undergoes rigorous testing on 2020 and 2021 datasets, providing predictions for accident rates from 2022 to 2031. Seasonality and trend considerations are incorporated for accurate forecasting.

### Data Visualization
PowerBI is employed for effective data visualization. Interactive dashboards provide a comprehensive view, facilitating the identification of patterns, trends, and correlations in road accident data.
