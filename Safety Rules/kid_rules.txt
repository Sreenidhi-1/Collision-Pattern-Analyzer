Here are some road safety precautions that kids should be aware of as they are growing up.

1. Children should know the basic safety signals and signs. They should know that green means to go through and red means to stop.
Also, they should learn not to stick out their hands from moving cars and vehicles.

2. They should know how to cross the road. So, the kids need to follow the stop, look and cross rule.
Kids should listen out for the horns and sound of vehicles. This way, they will be able to avoid vehicles that are coming from behind the bend.

3. Children should never run on roads, especially on busy ones. They may mistakenly collide with the cars and be the cause of an accident.
Additionally, children should always use the sidewalk. Moreover, they should be taught to cross only on the pedestrian crossing.

4. Also, children should avoid crossing the road on bends as motorists may not see them coming.

5. Road safety rules for kids include getting off the bus only at the curbside.
Also, do not suddenly open doors. Open doors only after looking behind you to see if no vehicles are coming that way.

6.Never wear dark-coloured clothes at night. Drivers should be able to recognise a person walking at a reasonable distance.
