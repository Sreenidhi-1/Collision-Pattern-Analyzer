Road safety in India is very poor. Despite several government rules and regulations, there are mishaps and accidents. Here are some of the issues that continue to plague us.

1. Bad Implementation of the Road Safety Standards- Sometimes, the correct road signs are not marked or implemented. These should be corrected at the earliest by the responsible authority.

2. Bad Vehicle Design- Indian car manufacturers do not design their vehicles with many safety features involved. 
Unlike the west, where cars are manufactured with many automatic safety features, Indian vehicles still lag.

3. Indifferent Governments- Governments do not plan their roads properly. Moreover, governments are also indifferent about the state of the roads.

4. Lack of Emergency Services- Even though there are road safety rules, there is a complete lack of emergency services. When a quick response team is not available, victims succumb to their injuries on the spot. 
Hence, it is highly important that there be emergency services.

5. Lack of Responsibility Among Citizens- Moreover, there is a complete lack of responsibility among citizens. Most of the time it is they who commit the wrong.

6. Poor Roads- Poor roads are always a cause of road accidents in India.
